Traditionally, to mine new crypto coins, a person (or group of people) would buy expensive computers and spend a lot of time and money running them to perform the difficult calculations to generate crypto coins. Some website owners have started taking a different approach; they have put the software which runs those difficult calculations into their websites Javascript. This then causes the computers belonging to the visitors of their website to run those calculations for them, instead of running them themselves. In other words, when you visit a website with an embedded crypto-miner in it, your computer and electricity is used to try to generate crypto-coins for the owners of that website. Although there are various measures being applied to stop these illegitimate minings, the trend is still increasing. This research aims to find out potential gaps in current methodologies and develop a solution that can fulfil the gap. It also aims to find out:',
